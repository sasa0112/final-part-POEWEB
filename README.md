1. Introduction

This project is a fully designed and developed website for a fictional bakery called The Bread Basket.
The site was created over three phases, where each part focused on improving different skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design.

The final website includes:

A homepage

Product page

About page

Gallery page

Contact page

Enquiry page

The goal of the project was to create a clean, user-friendly, and fully responsive site that demonstrates proper web development practices.

2. Part 1 – HTML Structure

In Part 1, I created the basic structure and layout for all the website pages using HTML5.

What I completed in this task

Built six pages using semantic HTML (header, nav, main, section, footer).

Added correct headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.

Included a navigation bar on every page.

Added alt text for accessibility.

Used basic inline CSS to guide layout before Part 2.

Ensured all the pages linked to each other properly.

Part 1 Outcome

The website had a complete structure and working navigation but still needed styling and responsiveness.

3. Part 2 – CSS and Responsive Design

Part 2 focused on improving the visual design and layout of the site using an external CSS file.

What I improved:
 1. External CSS File

All styling was moved into CSS/style.css, making the code cleaner and easier to manage.

 2. Full Website Styling

I added:

A warm color palette (cream and brown tones)

Google Fonts (Playfair Display + Lato)

Margins, padding, spacing

Styled product cards, gallery grids, nav bar, and buttons

 3. Responsive Design

I used:

Flexbox

CSS Grid

Media queries

This allows the site to adjust to:

Mobile phones

Tablets

Desktop screens

Part 2 Outcome

The website became visually appealing, organized, and responsive across different screen sizes.

4. Part 3 – JavaScript and Interactivity

Part 3 introduced JavaScript to make the website more interactive and user-friendly.

What I added:
 1. Image Slider on the Homepage

I created a working image slider with:

Previous/Next buttons

Auto-slide every 4 seconds

Smooth transitions

Responsive layout

This was added inside the <main> section of the homepage.

 2. Interactive Contact Form

The contact form now uses JavaScript to:

Display a popup message when the form is submitted

Clear the form after submission

Prevent page reload

 3. Smooth Scrolling

Navigation links now scroll smoothly to their sections.

 4. Accessibility Improvements

Added:

ARIA labels

Focus outlines

Improved contrast

Better alt text on all images

Part 3 Outcome
1. Image Slider (Home Page)

Added a fully functional & stylish image slider:

Auto-slide every 4 seconds

Manual Previous/Next buttons

Touch & swipe support

Smooth animations

Fully responsive

Keyboard accessible

Uses:
js/main.js

2. Popup Message (Contact Page)

Improved contact form with:

Instant popup on submission

Custom message

“Close” button

Form reset function

No page reload

3. Smooth Scrolling

Navigation links now scroll smoothly instead of jumping.

4. Accessibility Improvements (WCAG 2.2)

Focus states for all interactive elements

Color contrast improved

All images have descriptive alt text
